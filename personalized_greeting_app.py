# it took me time to get this right 
# my mistake was that i didn't use the f-string correctly 
# I never even knew what an f-string was until now

# key things to note: 
# 1. this is a tuple ()
# 2. the input function takes a string as an argument
# 3. print(f'hello[name]...') is the correct way to print a tuple variable
